# isonglycs400
This is a project that I created from my cs400 class at UW madison, I cant include the code but I included a video of me demonstrating the project. In this project, I used red-black trees, binary search trees and tree Iterators to read data from a song file and display the songs that I wanted using different commands to filter through the data.
